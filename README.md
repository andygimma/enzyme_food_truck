# Food Truck App

## Usage

1. This app uses `yarn`.
1. `$ nvm use` to ensure you are using the correct version of node.
1. `$ yarn` to install libraries.
1. `$ yarn run test` to test.
1. `$ yarn run format` to automatically format your code (works with VSCode!).
1. `$ yarn run start` to start the app.
## Hightlights

1. Uses ESLint and Prettier
1. Uses Typescript, with types and interfaces being used in the app
1. Uses react-intl for translations: Spanish, French, and English are supported
1. Uses animations for the list (though the library used is throwing a console error)
1. Well-tested
1. Leaflet maps interaction with the list using refs
1. The architecture should make it easy to find everything
1. Uses styled components, I think this shows more understanding of CSS than using something like MUI
1. Uses custom fonts and colors
1. Since data translations will be important for this app, we make sure it gets it's own high level folder. This also helps us ensure that we conform to our Typescript types.
